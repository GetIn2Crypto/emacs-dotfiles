# Emacs dotfiles by @squiter

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/squiter/emacs-dotfiles.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/squiter/emacs-dotfiles)

This is my emacs setup with a lot of packages and customizations. This
repository was build for my personal use, If you wan't to try, do it
by yourself.

## Requirements

This repository needs a `init-secrets.el` file inside `emacs.d/conf/`
directory that will load some constants in the environment.
