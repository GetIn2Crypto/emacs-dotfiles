Pomidor is a simple and cool [pomodoro technique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) timer.

## Installation

Clone the repo:
```sh
cd ~/.emacs.d
git clone https://github.com/TatriX/pomidor
```
Add to your .emacs:
```lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/pomidor/")
(require 'pomidor)

```

## Usage

Bind it to a key with the following command:

```lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "<f12>") #'pomidor)
```
Or run simply `M-x pomidor`

When you start pomidor, you automatically begin your first
pomodoro. There is nothing to do at this point, except to work. You
can, of course, restart the pomodoro if you get distracted, or even
the whole series, but the program takes care of itself until the
25-minute mark is reached. At this point, the overwork period will
start until you press `Space` to start break period.

Then you can press `Space` (ask for confirmation) or `Enter` to start a new period.

This cycle goes on forever.

By default pomidor will show you an overwork notification once per minute.

You can change default notification style globally:
